#Gene : coding & nocoding
###Why donhuman have so few genes?
central dogma of biology
DNA $\rarr$ mRNA $\rarr$ Protein
not completely
different types of RNAs $\rArr$ Coding and nocoding Genes

#Method : Sequencing & Computing
Pacific Biosciences, single molecule real-time
the new sequencing techologies
the big & high-dimensional data
three steps of bioinfo
information $\rarr$ model $\rarr$ algorithm
difference:
An algorithm is a well-defined set of procedures or instructions that run on data to create a model to perform a specific task.
Models are expressions that are run on data using algorithms that have been learnt.
